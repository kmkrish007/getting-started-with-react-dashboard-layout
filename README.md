# Getting Started with React Dashboard Layout of Syncfusion

The [React Dashboard Layout](https://www.syncfusion.com/react-ui-components/react-dashboard-layout?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=react-dashboard-layout-github-samples) is a grid-structured layout component that helps create static and dynamic dashboard layouts with panels. Dashboard panels are the basic building blocks of a dashboard and can be added programmatically or dynamically at runtime. The panels hold UI components and allow resizing, reordering, dragging and dropping, removing, and adding. This allows users to easily place components at the desired positions within the grid layout. 

## Features and benefits

### Dynamic layout design

The React Dashboard Layout component allows dynamic designing of the layout by adding, removing, resizing, floating, and reordering the panels within the layout.

#### Drag and Drop

React Dashboard Layout with rich UI provides smooth dragging of the panels to replace or re-order at the desired position within the layout.

#### Resizing

Easy resizing of a panel in all directions enables quick designing of the layout, and fitting small or large-sized content conveniently.

#### Floating

The panels within the layout will auto arrange by moving in the upward direction to occupy empty spaces available in the layout. This provides effective usage of the layout for panel placement. It has all the functionality you'll need to create beautiful, high-performance admin dashboards. With cool neutral colors and plenty of whitespace, it has a modern minimalist design style.

### Placing components as content

Place any HTML content or HTML UI components like Grid, Charts, Gauge, Maps, etc. to represent the metrics or KPI as panel content inside the dashboards.

### Responsive and adaptive layout

Design a mobile-friendly responsive dashboard that fits all resolutions without any data loss. Stacked panel display is much more adaptive to lower resolutions.

### Built-in themes

The React Admin Dashboard Layout supports several built-in themes such as material, bootstrap, fabric (Office 365), and high contrast. Users can customize any of these built-in themes or create new themes to achieve their own desired look and feel either by simply overriding SASS variables or using our Theme Studio application.
